	<p>
		These are instructions designed to make the searching process more fluid. </br >
		In these instructions two terms will be used frequently:
	</p>

<p>
- hit: A single instance of a passage being repeated in the dataset. A single hit will be a passage from page of a issue in the dataset. A single page may contain mulitple hits, though they're generally part of different clusters.
<br />
- cluster: A group of hits that all share the same (or similar enough) passage.
</p>

This search interface uses Solr as backend, therefore for the search terms it accepts everything that solr does.
<br />
Below are list of all available fields for searching and then some examples that show how some different search terms can be combined to get more out of the engine.

To search for a word, you can just type word into the search bar and the search engine will attempt to find hits with that word in its passage. When doing simple searches for a single word you can just use the word alone, but you can
<br />
also specify a field (which is also necessary for some more advanced searches). E.g. typing text:word into the search field will attempt to find all passages (field is called text) with the word 'word' in it. The different fields are 
<br />
shown below. The searchable fields depend on whether you're searching for hits or clusters. To search for clusters, you must specify it from the 'advanced search'.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Fields:

<br />
Available fields when searching for hits:
<br />
	cluster_id - Specifies which cluster this hit is part of. Can be used to find hits from the same cluster as some another hit.
<br />
	country - Country of the issue.
<br />
	date - Full date of the issue.
<br />
	doc_id - The exact ID of the page. This can be used to find all hits in a given page.
<br />
	length - The length of the hit.
<br />
	location - The city of the issue.
<br />
	text - The text of the hit.
<br />
	title - The title of the issue.
<br />
	year - Year of the issue.
<br />

<br />
	
Available fields when searching for clusters:
<br />
	all_countries - All countries the cluster spread to.
<br />
	all_locations - All cities the cluster spread to.
<br />
	average_length - The average length of all hits in the cluster.
<br />
	cluster_id - The ID of the cluster.
<br />
	count - The count of unique hits in the cluster.
<br />
	ending_country - The country of the last hit in the cluster.
<br />
	ending_date - The date of the last hit in the cluster.
<br />
	ending_location - The city of the last hit in the cluster.
<br />
	first_text - The text of the first hit in the cluster.
<br />
	gap - The biggest gap in the cluster, i.e. the maximum difference in publishing date of two subsequent hits.
<br />
	locations - The amount of different unique locations in the cluster.
<br />
	starting_country - The country of the first hit in the cluster.
<br />
	starting_date - The date of the first hit in the cluster.
<br />
	starting_location - The city of the first hit in the cluster.
<br />
	starting_year - The year of the first hit in the cluster.
<br />
	in_city -  The incoming city of this cluster.
<br />
	in_country - The incoming country of this cluster.
<br />
	in_date - Upcoming.
<br />
	out_city - The port city of this cluster.
<br />
	out_country - The port country of this cluster.
<br />
	out_date - Upcoming.
<br />
	timespan - The amount of days between the first and last hit in the cluster.
<br />
	titles - The amount of different unique titles in the cluster.
<br />
	virality_score - The virality score of the cluster.
<br />
	
<br />

<br />
Search instructions:

<br />
Solr has its own query language. Here are some of the more common ways to construct your queries.

<br />
+text:word -- the word 'word' _must_ appear in the text field of the hit.
<br />
-text:word -- the word 'word' must not appear in the text field of the hit.
<br />

<br />
These two can also be combined:
<br />
+text:word -text:cat - The word 'word' must appear in the text and the world 'cat' can not.
<br />

<br />
Different solr terms are separated using whitespace, so if you want to search for a multi word phrase, you must wrap it to quotation marks:
<br />
text:"this is a word" - "This is a word" must appear in the passage.
<br />
